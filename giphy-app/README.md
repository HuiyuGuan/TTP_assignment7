To use the app, you must first create a config.js file. This file will contain your api key from giphy.com
Don't worry, the key is free to get. 

Use this format in the config.js file:

        export const My_Api_key = { key:"insert your api key here }


import the key to your App.js folder with:

            import {My_Api_key} from "./config"

And that's it.
